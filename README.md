 Here, I have tried to detect spams from a dataset containing messages. Using LSTM, we are able to predict whether a given message is a spam or a ham. LSTM stands for Long Short Term Memory model. It is a type/variant of vanilla RNN (Recurring Neural Networks). Since RNN's have got some significant limitations such as that of Vanishing Gradient Descent problem and poor performance in cases involving 'Long Term Dependencies', LSTM's offer an alternative by overcoming these limitations. That's why, LSTM's are found to be more convenient and reliable (as in here the messages in the dataset involve long term dependency but LSTM handles it well).
